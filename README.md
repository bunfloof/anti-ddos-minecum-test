## Notes

- For VampSMP, my favorite furry Minecraft server, that keeps on getting DDoSed by some kid. 

- These are only experimental snippets intended for use under protected upstreams. Tested with: Path.net and Voxility.

### Attack Report on 07-31-2023
The client connects to the server, sends a "Ping" packet, sends a "Handshake" packet with a protocol version of 2 (which is invalid since Minecraft version 1.20.1 uses 763), sends a "Login" packet with a strange username, and the client closes the connection.

I temporarily enabled passthrough on the server's firewall to capture this attack.

### Attack Report on 08-01-2023

The attacker appears to be using a bot to rapidly create and drop connections, each sending a "Handshake" packet and a "Login" packet with a specific, human, constant username. Still, they're using the wrong protocol version for attacking a Minecraft version 1.20.1 server.
